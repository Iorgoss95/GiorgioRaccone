I'm at the beginning of my journey, but I like to develop websites that are beautiful and most
                importantly functional for users. <br>
                I especially like the frontend, because it allows me to work with shapes, colors and ux layouts.
                but i don't despise everything that has to do with technology. <br>
                I listen a lot of music and play tennis in my spare time.
